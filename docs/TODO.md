# Todo

What is outstanding, and who has to do it. Things that only a person with
console access can do are marked **manual** — they cannot be scripted from
this repository.

## Do these next

- [ ] **manual — Require a reviewer on the `infra` environment.**
      GitHub → Settings → Environments → `infra` → Required reviewers.
      Without it, the Infrastructure workflow's apply is one click for anyone
      who can trigger a workflow, and that account holds
      `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin` — it can change who has access
      to the project. The manual-dispatch gate only means something once a
      second person has to approve it. See
      [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#why-it-differs-from-the-plan).

- [ ] **manual — Try a QR check-in end to end.** Sign in as a Top 8, open an
      event's organizer screen, and scan the code with a second account. It is
      the one member-facing flow that has never been exercised against the
      live stack. Everything around it is covered by tests; the camera and the
      60-second token expiry are not.

- [ ] **manual — Archive `Esgartaq04/shpe-web-app`.** The mirror existed only
      because the old hosts could not build from the team repository. Nothing
      pushes to it now.

## Housekeeping

- [ ] Delete the stale local branch `ci/skip-deploy-on-docs-only`. It carries
      duplicate copies of the avatar commits; pushing it would drag unrelated
      work into that PR. Its real work is already merged.

- [ ] Make `env.ts` validation lazy per entry point. Today it validates every
      required variable on import, so the migration job has to be handed a
      QR-signing secret it never uses. Each entry point should require only
      what it actually reads.

- [ ] Consider an `expo lint` rule or a CI check that catches
      `frontend/package.json` dependencies with no importer, so the peer-only
      ones stay documented rather than rediscovered. See the note in the
      README's repository layout section before removing anything there.

## Security

- [x] **Rotated 2026-08-31.** A committed Terraform plan archive exposed the
      database password, `CHECKIN_TOKEN_SECRET`, and `SYNC_SECRET` in a public
      repository. All three were regenerated and the service redeployed, so
      the exposed values are dead. `.gitignore` now covers plan archives,
      which the existing `*.tfstate` rules did not.

      The old values remain in git history and in any clone or fork made
      before the rotation. That is accepted: rotation is what makes them
      worthless, and rewriting public history would break every clone while
      GitHub may still serve the old commit from cache. If the repository is
      ever made private-then-public again, or a secret scanner flags it,
      point at this entry.

- [ ] Consider enabling GitHub secret scanning and push protection on the
      repository. It is free for public repositories and would have caught
      the above before it was pushed.

## Deferred features

These are visible in the app as *Coming soon* rather than hidden, so nobody
mistakes them for broken:

- [ ] **Google sign-in.** Harder than it looks now: client-side signup is
      disabled at the platform level to keep the `@uic.edu` rule enforceable,
      so federated sign-in needs either pre-linked accounts or a Firebase
      blocking function that applies the same domain check.
- [ ] **Password reset.** Firebase Authentication makes this close to free —
      it is a sendPasswordResetEmail call plus an authorized action URL.
- [ ] **Notifications**, **RSVP**, and **privacy settings**. Designed in the
      superpowers specs, never built.
- [ ] **The first Top 8 is still a SQL step.** Documented in
      [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md#the-first-top-8-has-to-be-made-by-hand);
      everything after the first one happens in the app.

## Test coverage not yet taken

The suites cover the privilege guards, the auth lifecycle, the avatar flow,
and the pure logic. Still uncovered, in rough order of value:

- [ ] `routes/events.ts` and `routes/announcements.ts` at the route level —
      particularly that a draft is invisible to a member and visible to an
      officer, which is a documented rule with nothing enforcing it in CI.
- [ ] `routes/checkIns.ts` — the duplicate-scan rejection relies on a unique
      index, so it needs a real database rather than a mock to test honestly.
- [ ] `calendar/sync.ts` — the re-entrancy guard that stops two syncs
      overlapping.
- [ ] The remaining screens and data hooks (`dashboard`, `events`, `home`,
      `organizer`, `lib/checkIns.ts`, `lib/adminStats.ts`).
